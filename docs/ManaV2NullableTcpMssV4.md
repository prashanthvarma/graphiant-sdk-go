## Methods

### NewManaV2NullableTcpMssV4

`func NewManaV2NullableTcpMssV4() *ManaV2NullableTcpMssV4`

NewManaV2NullableTcpMssV4 instantiates a new ManaV2NullableTcpMssV4 object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewManaV2NullableTcpMssV4WithDefaults

`func NewManaV2NullableTcpMssV4WithDefaults() *ManaV2NullableTcpMssV4`

NewManaV2NullableTcpMssV4WithDefaults instantiates a new ManaV2NullableTcpMssV4 object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetTcpMssV4

`func (o *ManaV2NullableTcpMssV4) GetTcpMssV4() int32`

GetTcpMssV4 returns the TcpMssV4 field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetTcpMssV4Ok

`func (o *ManaV2NullableTcpMssV4) GetTcpMssV4Ok() (*int32, bool)`

GetTcpMssV4Ok returns a tuple with the TcpMssV4 field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetTcpMssV4

`func (o *ManaV2NullableTcpMssV4) SetTcpMssV4(v int32)`

SetTcpMssV4 sets TcpMssV4 field to given value.

### HasTcpMssV4

`func (o *ManaV2NullableTcpMssV4) HasTcpMssV4() bool`

HasTcpMssV4 returns a boolean if a field has been set.
